# WHAT IS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY?

Disruptive Technologies or disruptive innovations are defined by **Clayton Christensen** as, **_“…it transforms a product that historically was so expensive and complicated that only a few people with a lot of money and a lot of skill had access to it Disruptive innovation makes it so much more affordable and accessible to a much larger population.”(2012)_** Basically, it is a strategy that companies (entrant) use by offering products that are low-quality and cheap versions of other more expensive products. Overtime, product’s quality improves, and in doing so garners more patrons upmarket, until they are level with big companies (incumbent), which by then causes a “disruption” in the market.

## ONLINE LEARNING

## Why is it **_"DISRUPTIVE"_** ? 

Online Learning is a disruptive innovation because of the following:
-	School fees are expensive.
-	Places of learning are located in one place, meaning it can be hard to reach it at times.
-	Online Learning is relatively less expensive than schools
-	It is also easier to access.
This innovation is legitimately “disruptive” because it passes the 3-set Litmus Test, also created by Clayton Christensen:
3 set Litmus Test for Disruptive Ideas:
	**Set 1:**
1)	Is there a large population of people who historically have not had the money, equipment, or skill to do this thing for themselves, and as a result have gone without it altogether or have needed to pay someone with more expertise to do it for them? 
A: YES
2)	To use the product or service, do customers need to go to an inconvenient, centralized location? 
A: YES
    **Set 2:**
1)	Are there customers at the low end of the market who would be happy to purchase a product with less (but good enough) performance if they could get it at a lower price? 
A: YES
2)	Can we create a business model that enables us to earn attractive profits at the discount prices required to win the business of these overserved customers at the low end?
A: YES
	**Set 3:**
1)	Is the innovation disruptive to all of the significant incumbent firms in the industry? If it appears to be sustaining to one or more significant players in the industry, then the odds will be stacked in that firm’s favor, and the entrant is unlikely to win.
A: YES
(Christensen, 1997)

According to Christensen, **_“If an idea fails the litmus tests, then it cannot be shaped into a disruption. It may have promise as a sustaining technology, but in that case we would expect that it could not constitute the basis of a new-growth business for an entrant company.” (1997)_**
